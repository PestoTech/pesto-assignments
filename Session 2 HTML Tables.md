1\. Create a table with 3 rows and 3 columns. The top row contains 1 cell that spans 3 columns. The leftmost cell on the next row spans 2 rows. All other cells span a single row and column.

Each cell has a number. The numbers can be put in a "h1" tag if desired. The image below shows what the table should look like using "h1" tags around the numbers.
